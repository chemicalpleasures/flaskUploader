Target+ error parsing is a tedious daily process for our Product Launch team, requiring manual download of reports from Salsify and the Target+ portal, various VLOOKUPs comparing the two sheets and filtering. This tool solves that by joining the two sheets and automating the process using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library and wrapping it in Flask for a simple web UI usable by Product Launch.
